Welcome to Inner Demons!
Inner Demons lets you fight terrifying raid bosses and buy exotic weapons when you work towards your personal goals.

How to use this app:

Goals are broken down into tasks.

Goals give you experience. When you have enough experience, you level up and gain access to more weapons and enemies.

Tasks give you gold. You can use this gold to buy exciting new weapons.

On the homepage, click your tasks to complete them for the day and cash in on your gold.
When you have finished all of one goal's tasks, you can click COMPLETE to finish your task for the day and earn your experience.

When you're ready, head over to the battle page to take on enemies!

When you defeat an enemy, you gain them as an ally, and they can help you in future battles!
