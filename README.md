How to use this app:

Goals are broken down into tasks.

Goals give you experience. When you have enough experience, you level up and gain access to more weapons and enemies.

Tasks give you gold. You can use this gold to buy exciting new weapons.

On the homepage, click your tasks to complete them for the day and cash in on your gold.
When you have finished all of one goal's tasks, you can click COMPLETE to finish your task for the day and earn your experience.

When you're ready, head over to the battle page to take on enemies!

When you defeat an enemy, you gain them as an ally, and they can help you in future battles!

You will start by coming to a page that looks like this:

Your attack is made by combining Ally Attack + Weapon Attack. Chaos is the chance for a critical, which does double damage. Once a monster is killed, they become you servant to use in new battles!

Once there, you will need to battle your first creature!  Our recommendation is to defeat the dread quokka Reginald.  He is here:

Tasks completed give you that sweet, sweet gold, which can be used to buy things on the shop tab. We recommend the "Damonblade" as this game is filled with Damons. The store page looks like this:
